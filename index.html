      <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
      industry. <i>Lorem Ipsum</i> has been the industry's standard dummy text
      ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
      scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br /><br />
      <mark> It has survived not only five centuries </mark>
      , but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
      Ipsum.
